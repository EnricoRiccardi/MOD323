# Learn Machine Learning with Python in two days [WIP]
(Work in progress) Material prepared for MOD323 at University of Stavanger. The documents have been prepared by the use of [doconce](https://github.com/doconce/doconce). 

The course uses, as a base, the material of MOD321 and MOD322. MOD321 documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/ahiorth/Pytato/tree/master/doc/pub/).
