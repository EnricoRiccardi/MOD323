======= What is the point then? What to expect? =======
Machine learning is a rapidly expanding field, constantly evolving and developing.
The pace of development is so fast that even professionals working in ML daily struggle to keep up with the field's advancements. 
In just two days, one cannot expect to become an expert, yett we will cover the key aspects of ML and explore the opportunities it offers. 
We will introduce the major ML python libraries available and apply a set of them in hands-on exercises and tutorials, with applications in geophysics and other areas.

======= About this course =======
This course is designed to help you formulate questions that can be effectively addressed using machine learning approaches. Through various examples, we will explore how data can be gathered, refined, and ideally utilized to train machine learning algorithms. We will also discuss the realistic expectations and limitations of such methods. Moreover, the course will guide you in developing your own Python code to tackle various, manageable ML challenges. We will create ML programs using generative AI and other freely available code repositories within the Python ecosystem.
