!bblock Multimodal AI
An AI that processes and interprets multiple types of data inputs â€” such as text, images, audio, and video
!eblock

M-AI can make decisions or provide insights (it thus combines unsupervised, supervised and reinforcement learning).

It uses an integrated set of different neural networks with different architectures each of which is designed to handle specific types of input data.

Applications:
* Autonomous Vehicles
* Healthcare Diagnostics
* Humanoids
* Interactive machine
* Augmented data

===== Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) =====

!bblock Definition
A class of machine learning frameworks where two neural networks contest with each other to generate new, synthetic instances of data that can pass for real data.
