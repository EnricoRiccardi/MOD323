What is the main difference between the three fields?


Statistics (origin "description of a state/country") is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. 

It is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied.
Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as "all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". 

Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.[Wikipedia]
