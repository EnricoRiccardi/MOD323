As one can note, these challenges are still present in gen AI.

===== Goal =====

Big data was considered a revolution, where machine could take over human intelligence thanks
to the immense quantity of data available and on the data processing speed.

Now (2024) big data is considered a simple base for gen AI and it is pretty much forgotten by most.
