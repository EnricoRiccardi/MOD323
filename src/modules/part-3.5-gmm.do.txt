======= Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) =======

Gaussian Mixture is a probabilistic model that tries to split the data into clusters.

Each cluster is represented by a centre (its mean) and a Gaussian distribution around it with different variance for the different dimensions.

To each datapoint, a belonging probability to each cluster is assigned.

!bblock Assumption
Data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters.

===== Limitations =====

The method is rather powerful, but it has quite significant drawbacks:

!bpop
* The method can be rather unstable and not converge for 'poor' data.

* Iterative procedure is usually needed and convergence depends on initial guest.

* Interpretability of the results might be rather poor.

* High dimensionality limitations.

* Computationally expensive

===== GMM model development =====

!bt
\begin{displaymath}
p(x) = \sum^K_{k=1} w_k f_k(x, \theta_k)
\end{displaymath}
!et

where
* $p(x)$ is the overall density or mass function of the mixture model.
* $K$ is the number of distributions to be considered
* $g_k(x,\theta_k)$ is the density mass function of the k-th component
* $\theta_k$ are the parameters for the $g_k()$ distribution

and where a Gaussian is:

!bt
\begin{displaymath}
g(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt(2 \pi)} exp ( - \frac{1}{2} \frac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2})
\end{displaymath}
!et

===== GMM usage example =====

GMM is used in a large span of fields:

!bpop
* Clustering: GMMs can identify clusters with different shapes and sizes due to their probabilistic nature, making them suitable for more complex datasets.

* Anomaly Detection: By modelling the normal behaviour of data through its distribution, GMMs can be used to detect outliers or anomalous events.

* Image Segmentation: In computer vision, GMMs can be used for image segmentation, where the goal is to partition an image into segments based on the colours or textures.

* Speech Recognition: GMMs have been used in speech recognition systems to model the distribution of audio features.

* Bioinformatics: GMMs are used in bioinformatics for tasks such as modelling gene expression data or protein structure. They can help in identifying biological patterns or clusters within the data that are not immediately apparent.

* Astronomy: GMMs are used in astronomy to classify celestial objects and to estimate the distribution of stars or galaxies based on their properties, such as brightness and colour.
