* The aim is identifying the underlying structure, trends, and relationships inherent in the data.

* Is it all statistics then? Yes.

===== Data properties =====
Before to talk about machine learning, we need to establish some terminology.

!bpop
!bblock Population
The universe of all possible outcomes and events,
!eblock

!bblock Sample
A finite subset extracted from the population
!eblock

!bblock Exaustivity
The samples coverd the population spectra.
!eblock

!bblock Representativity 
The population is properly described by the samples.

===== Big data =====
We speak of bid data hen dataset are very large: i.e. many instances and features
Models have thus a large set of parameters (and often no one has a clue anymore of what is going on).

!bpop
* Volume of data
* Variety different type of data sources with different length and scale.
* Frequency of data generation
!epop



!split
===== Sampling =====

Samples shall have not bias (to be randomly selected). If not, the bias have to be corrected for.

!bpop
!bblock Cycle of data (curing)
o Data is collected
o Checked upon
o Some modelling
o Analysis and visualization
o AnOmLiEs and outliers detection (exclusion?)
