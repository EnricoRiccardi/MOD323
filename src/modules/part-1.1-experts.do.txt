===== Who to talk to? =====
We established that machine learning and artificial intelligence is a huge field.
The consequence is that one need to know how to approach the field in order to get
the proper guidance.

As a parallel, if you are sick, you need to contact the right person. Contacting a surgeon will
most likely result in a waste of time, your and her/his. Yet surgeons are between
the most competent people in medicine.

!split
===== Who does what =====
Different disciplines and thus actors can be involved:

!bblock Data Scientists
 They specialise in analysing and interpreting complex datasets using a variety of techniques, including machine learning.
Data scientists can help you understand whether your problem can be addressed through data analysis and machine learning, and they can develop statistical models for it. Statistical models have severe limitations, even when derived from Big Data. (i.e. limited understanding).
!eblock

\pause

!bblock Computational Engineers
 These professionals specialise in designing, building, and implementing machine learning models.
They have a strong background in engineering along with expertise in machine learning algorithms. The focus is on the understanding of the problem to solve, which is a much slower and demanding task.
!eblock

!split
===== Who does what =====

!bblock AI Researchers or Specialists:
When a problem is very well defined and/or requires cutting-edge machine learning techniques,
consulting with AI researchers or specialists in the specific field of AI that can relate to a target problem (like natural language processing, computer vision, etc.) might be beneficial. This is mostly the generative AI domain, while it has been mostly a failure for ML.

!bblock Computer Scientists/Software Engineers
As a large portion in ML is data processing, data privacy and output analysis, significant computational challenges might arise due to Big Data. This is still within AI, yet it is not within ML.

===== A safe way to approach =====
Machine learning can be thought of as a large and vast set of efficient numerical recipes that can provide statistical insight into problems.

!bpop
* There is a large effort of providing ML tool openly

* Be able to use ML can be a boomerang (when not knowing the limitations of statistical models)

* Specialised professional in ML/AI see mostly the data science side: high risk to solve irrelevant questions
!epop


!split
===== Why is it so complicated? =====
A problem to be addressed by advanced statistical methods needs to be sectioned into its components.

!bblock Domain expertise, computational engineers
Data acquisition, data curing/wrangling, data preprocessing and filtering,
!eblock

\pause

!bblock Data scientists/Engineers
Model selection, model training, testing and validation.
!eblock

\pause

!bblock Data scientist
Computational stability, speed, privacy and reliability.

!split
===== Bias in approaches selection =====
As ML users often specialise in one or more methods, there is a consequent propensity to
apply such a method into the largest set of applications possible.

While this is humanly understandable, it is not the best practice and can lead to
wrong solution that do not even translate into better understanding.

!bblock A statement with tons of bias
Experience is showing that most out of ML can be obtained by 'enhancing' domain experts.

===== Black Box approaches =====
If the result is correct, do you care that it is so for the right reason?

Do you even care? Maybe not and it is good like that.

Why should you?


!split
===== Handling a Black Box =====
If your intent is not to become a ML developer, you will have to accept to use a black box approach.

We do not know how a smart-phone works, yet we (assume to) know how to use it!

* Is it useful?
* Is it safe?
* Is it ethical?

!split
===== Some solutions =====
Data scientist are working hard to try to solve some of the previous questions:

Two main interesting initiative:

* Interpretable AI: it aims to show the 'reasoning' of a ML algorithm, which can allow the consideration of
different ethical concerns.
* Causal analysis: it aims to find the causal relation between variables (instead of just correlations).

!split
===== Garbage in, Garbage out =====
This is one of the fundamental baselines of ML. It doesn't matter what approach one uses. If data are garbage, model prediction will be garbage.
Collecting data hoping that something will come out is often the perfect recipe for disasters.

!split
===== No free lunch theorem =====
!bblock
The theorem states that all optimization algorithms perform equally well when their performance is averaged across all possible problems.
!eblock

\pause

* The performance of all optimization algorithms are identical, under some specific constraints.
* There is probably no single best optimization algorithm or machine learning algorithm.

\pause

!bblock
If one algorithm performs better than another algorithm on one class of problems, then it will perform worse on another class of problems
