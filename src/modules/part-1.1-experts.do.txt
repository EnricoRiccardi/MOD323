===== Who to talk to? =====
We established that machine learning and artificial intelligence is a huge field.
The consequence is that one need to know how to approach the field in order to get
the proper guidance.

As a parallel, if you are sick, you need to contact the right person. Contacting a surgeon will
most likely result in a waste of time, your and her/his. Yet surgeons are between
the most competent people in medicine.

===== Who does what =====
Different disciplines and thus actors can be involved:

!bpop
* Data Scientists: They specialise in analysing and interpreting complex datasets using a variety of techniques, including machine learning.
Data scientists can help you understand whether your problem can be addressed through data analysis and machine learning, and they can develop models to solve it.

* Computational Engineers: These professionals specialise in designing, building, and implementing machine learning models.
They have a strong background in software engineering along with expertise in machine learning algorithms.

* AI Researchers or Specialists: If your problem is highly specialised or requires cutting-edge machine learning techniques,
consulting with AI researchers or specialists in the specific field of AI that relates to your problem (like natural language processing, computer vision, etc.) might be beneficial.

* Computer Scientists/Software Engineers with ML Experience: Some software engineers or computer scientists,
though not exclusively focused on machine learning, might have significant experience in applying ML techniques to practical problems.

===== Who does what =====
Different disciplines and thus actors can be involved (continue):

!bpop
* Industry-Specific Experts with ML Background: Depending on your problem, experts in a particular industry who have experience with machine learning can provide valuable insights.
For example, for a healthcare-related problem, a bioinformatician or medical informatics professional with machine learning experience could be ideal.

* Consultancy Firms specialising in AI and ML: There are firms that specialise in providing AI and ML solutions to a range of problems across different industries.
They can offer a *team* of experts to work on your problem.

* Academic Institutions: Universities and research institutions often have departments or labs dedicated to machine learning and AI research.

===== Why is it so complicated? =====
A problem to be addressed by advanced statistical methods needs to be sectioned into its components.

* Data acquisition, data curing/wrangling, data preprocessing and filtering,
Domain expertise, computational engineers.

* Model selection, model training, testing and validation.
Data scientists/Engineers.

* Output stability and reliability.
Data scientist.

===== Bias in approaches selection =====
As ML users often specialise in one or more methods, there is a consequent propensity to
apply such a method into the largest set of applications possible.

While this is humanly understandable, it is not the best practice and can lead to
bad solution.

===== Black Box approaches =====
If the result is correct, do you care that it is so for the right reason?

Do you even care? Maybe not and it is good like that.

Why should you?


!split
===== Handling a Black Box =====
If your intent is not to become a ML developer, you will have to accept to use a black box approach.

We do not know how a smart-phone works, yet we (assume to) know how to use it!

Is it useful? Is it safe? Is it ethical?


!split
===== Opening a Black Box =====
But if you need to develop an insight,
consider interpretable AI methods: it is a whole new exciting field that is now
emerging.

Interpretable AI can be pivotal for ML development, because it allow the consideration of
different ethical concerns.


!split
===== Garbage in, Garbage out =====
This is one of the fundamental baselines of ML. It doesn't matter what approach one uses. If data are garbage, model prediction will be garbage.
Collecting data hoping that something will come out is often the perfect recipe for disasters.

!split
===== No free lunch theorem =====
!bblock
The theorem states that all optimization algorithms perform equally well when their performance is averaged across all possible problems.
!eblock

\pause

* The performance of all optimization algorithms are identical, under some specific constraints.
* There is provably no single best optimization algorithm or machine learning algorithm.

\pause

!bblock
If one algorithm performs better than another algorithm on one class of problems, then it will perform worse on another class of problems
