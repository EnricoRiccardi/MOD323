======= Neural Network, -NN-  =======
One of the most famous models in Machine Learning is _Neural Network_.

The name comes from how the brain functions: a set of connected neurons that are either off or active.

In its essence, 
!bblock
NN is a large set of linear regressions exeuted both in parallel and in series.
!eblock

Conventional NN are composed by:

!bpop
o Input layer 
o Hidden layers
o Output layers
!epop

which, together, can approximately approximate any function in any dimension.

Each architecutre is optmized for a specific problem.
Furthermore, connections map is also a NN design variable.

===== NN types =====

THere are also differnt types of NN:
!bpop
* ANN (atificial NN), just another name for NN
* DNN (deep) deep neural network
* RNN (recurrent NN) for audio
* CNN (convolutional NN) for images
* Autoencoder (for PCA) to compress to a latent space and decompress data
* Deep autoencoder (for interpretability)
* Physics informed NN (to merge NN to differentail equations)
* ... and more ...
!epop

tensorflow, pytotch and keras are the most popular and popular libraries for NN
