===== MetaData properties =====
Data without metadata are just number (i.e. if they are integers, they are only good to play lottery)

Metadata can be pretty much anything. Depending on the application, we can distinguish between:
!bpop
o Descriptive : used for discovery and identification. It includes elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.
o Structural : describe containers of data and indicates how compound objects are put together. It describes the types, versions, relationships, and other characteristics of digital materials.
o Administrative : to help manage a resource, like resource type, permissions, and when and how it was created.
o Reference : to indicate the information about the contents and quality of statistical data.
o Statistical : (or process data), may describe processes that collect, process, or produce statistical data.
o Legal : creator, copyright, licencing.

These characteristics are all needed when constructing data repositories.

===== MetaData for sharing and reuse =====
* Metadata are more and more important in a digital open world. 

!bpop
* Researchers and automatic algorithms would benefit to import data directly.

* FAIR research is an important part of Open Science revolution (Findable, Accessible, interoperable, Reusable)

* New application, business, discovberies can be thus enabled.

* ChatGPT, Bard, Gemini, and all the LLMs are possible only thanks to this!

Samples shall have not bias (to be randomly selected). If not, the bias have to be corrected for.
