===== Hard and soft modeling =====
Models allow us to predict ’the future’, or describe the past and
present (what is the present...?)

=== Three main families: ===
o Hard models (physics)
o Soft models (statistic)
o Machine learning (both?!)

!split
===== Hard modeling =====

*  Based on an accurate physical description of the system and
  mathematical modeling (e.g. differential equations).
  Hard models are often deterministic.
!bpop
* Hard-modeling methods usually use
  optimization methods to find out the best values for
  the parameters of the model.

* Hard-modeling is preferable in laboratory experiments,
  where all the variables are controlled and the physicochemical
  nature of the dynamic model is known and can be fully described
  using a known mathematical model.

* Hard-modeling, if successful, usually gives better understanding
  of a system and better extrapolations. Wrong assumptions often leads to
  non-sense results.

!split
===== Soft modeling =====
* Soft-modeling describes systems without the need of an *a priori* physical or (bio)chemical model postulation. They are _data driven_ models.

!bpop
* Soft models are much easier to make than hard models.

* Soft modeling can be used to understand complex relationships.

* Soft modeling needs (much) more data than hard-modeling.

* Soft models have a poor extrapolating capabilities (compared with hard-modeling)

===== How to create hard models? =====
After understanding the problem to be solved we need to:

o Link mathematics to physics.
o Define boundary conditions and constitutive equations.
o Make tons of assumptions.
o Solve the constitutive equation in space and time.
o CHeck solution stability and sensitivity analysis.
o A long set of judicious approximations have to be taken.
o It is hard (but we are engineers!).
o Get quite some money for the awesome job.

!split
===== How to create soft models? =====

After understanding the general problem to be solved we need to:

* Determine a suitable _numerical description_ .
* Choose a suitable _model_ to which parameters are fitted.
* Train, test, validate the model.
* Perform _data analysis_ with chosen method(s).
* Link predictions with expectations.
