===== What ML can do in GEO? =====

!bpop
o Handle too large dataset
o Handle dataset with too many dimensions
o Automate long repetitive and low value tasks
o Support decision making
o Implement expert assesment
o Provide visualization and analysis
o Correct models with data (e.g. geosteering)

!split
===== Application examples =====
It all starts from the question! 

Is data fit for the task? 

!bpop
o Prompt anamolous operation conditions (safe drilling).
Frequency? Resolution? Interpretability? Variable types?
o Feature detection/guided interpretation.
Significance? Labeling strategy? Correlated data? Statistical interactions?

===== General Work Flow =====
Also in geo applications, a predominant quantity of time/effort shall be dedicated to data retrival, preparation, interpretation.

!bpop
o Data preparation
o Model selection
o Model training and tuning
o Model testing, inference and validation
o Result intepretation
!epop


!split
===== Data preparation =====
The hands on operation begin with the data!

!bpop
o metadata preparation
o dataset preparation
o filtering
o cure data

!split
===== Metadata =====

Data without metadata are just numbers: useless.

Metadata quality is a necessary pre-condition
!bpop
!bblock What is metadata?
A set of data that described and fives information about other data [wiki]

===== Black box =====

Machine learning offers a (super) large set of statistical based tools that are, in essence, a black box. 

!bblock Use with CAUTION!
As every black box, they are not fully reliable.
!eblock

Here some guide:
!epop
o Use the simplest approach! 
o Consider approach quality! 
o Compare your results with benchmarks.
o Avoid not reporducible studies.
o Prioritize intepretability above computational speed and accuracy.
