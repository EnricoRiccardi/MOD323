===== Unsupervised learning =====
Unsupervised learning, a term that resonates with the autonomy of machine intelligence, operates on the principle of identifying patterns and structures in datasets without labelled responses.

This branch of machine learning is distinguished by its lack of explicit guidance, where algorithms are tasked with uncovering hidden structures from unlabeled data.

The most common clustering strategies are :
* filtering
* clustering
* dimensionality reduction
* association learning

!split
===== Application of unsupervised learning =====
It is a bit of a holy grail: a computer that finds patterns without guidance.
(Yes, it doesn't work, most of the time)


\pause

Still, it has been shown efficient for:

* Computer vision
* Anomaly detection
* Exploratory data analysis

!bblock Main challenge
The right result is quite undefined,
Uncertain goal.

===== Goals =====
Finding a pattern in data does not mean to find something useful.

!bblock
Relevant is not the same as causal.

!bblock
Correlation is not causation.
!eblock

\pause

As we do not have a 'truth', or a supervision, we can look for data-patterns by 
* grouping strategy according to some properties analogy
* reducing variance within groups.

!bblock
Note: these approaches will (almost) always converge or provide information. Which is a better outcome, strategy or model parameter can be, at the end, only evaluated with domain expertise.

===== Common approaches =====
The number of unsupervised approach is tremendous, yet, the most common are the following:

!bpop
* k-means (rigid clustering)
* Gaussian mixed model (soft clustering)
* Hierarchical clustering (grouping into trees/dendrograms)
* Principal component analysis (PCA) (Principal components identifications,)
* Auto-encoders (data compression)
!epop

We will discuss a few of them.
