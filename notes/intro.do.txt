======= Where is the value ? Why this course?  =======
Decisions are the cardinal. What influences your decisions has value.
Better results comes from better decisions. Note that this is a STATISTICAL argument.

Life is a sum of all your choices (Albert Camus)

Here we will learn to use data to make better decisions. Each application is a mere exercise, an application of various techinques. Our aim here is to provide a good guidance how to link data to value creation. That is to understand uncertainity.

We will analyse, quantify and structure models as a function of uncertainity.

Probability is the language of uncertainity!



Spatial and Temporal Modelling - What is it?

Big data analytics: Spatial and Temporal Statistic U Big Data

Spatial temp data come at a wide range of scales. ST data comes with a time/space dependent data.

We need to clearify comunication of the stats analysis outcomes-


======= Probability! =======
Data nalytics concepts
Data Sources and quality 
Probability
(list)
Exploratory data analysis
(list)

======= Modelling =======
Confidence intervals and hyphotesis testing
Correlation
Regressions
Spatial bias 
- Declustering
Stationarity
Continuity
Variograms 
Trend modeling and Krigin
Machine learning
- Principar component analysis
- Decision trees

========= Outcomes ========
Applications:
Energy and minela resources
Agriculture and weather modeling
Commodity, currencu, stock and financial markets
Modelling associated incertainities in prices and costs
Support decision making
-ADD MORE-


Tool box:
Scale of data
Allowing handling the many uncertainities
Data relationship (P and physical)
Expertise knowledge


Example:
Spacial simulation of porosity:
Sequential Gaussian Simulation from data from wells (Friging)
Financial case, stock price from Monte Carlo simulations.

SURVEY!

===== Class Strategy: =====
A combination of lectures, demonstrations and hands out

Lectures
- provide the fundamental theory with a focus on practice

Demonstrations 
- python and excel

Tutorials:
- Exercise


===== Modern statistic and Machine learning =====
- Drammatically changes.
- A lot of models can be used with less understanding.
- Powerful method comes with higher responsability.
- Statistical limitation remains even when we use more advanced method.
- Having a good backgroud is thus still necessary. 


===== Course delivery: =====
The lectures will be given in the lecture room - physical attendance only.
One day of theory, one of Q&A, tutorials and practical exercise.
- Teaching material will be disclosed, same as assigment.
- The assignements will be discussed in class, but the results will not be disclosed online.
- why in class? Because we saw that this is the most effective approach.
- Please do not be a mere spectator.

===== Assessment =====
Why? 
- To encourace to revise and structure your knowledge.
- Test your understanding and learning (not your memory).
- Assignements have to be passed.
